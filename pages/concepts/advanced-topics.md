## Composition and Privacy Budget Management

When multiple queries are performed on the same dataset, the privacy guarantees of differential privacy compose. This means that the total privacy loss accumulates across queries. Understanding composition is crucial for managing privacy budgets effectively.

### Basic Composition

Under basic composition, if we perform k queries each satisfying ε-differential privacy, the total privacy loss is at most kε. This additive property is fundamental to privacy budget management.

### Advanced Composition

More sophisticated composition theorems can provide better bounds on privacy loss when multiple queries are performed. Advanced composition can offer better privacy accounting in scenarios with many queries.

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing differential privacy in practice, several factors must be considered:

1. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Determining the sensitivity of queries is crucial for calibrating noise appropriately.

2. **Noise Calibration**: Different noise distributions (Laplace, Gaussian) may be appropriate for different scenarios.

3. **Privacy Budget Allocation**: Deciding how to distribute privacy budget across different queries and time periods.

4. **Utility Optimization**: Balancing privacy protection with data utility requirements.

## Future Directions

The field of differential privacy continues to evolve with new mechanisms, improved composition theorems, and novel applications in machine learning and data analytics.
