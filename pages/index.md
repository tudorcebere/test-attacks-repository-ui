    on output privacy attacks and auditing. The repository is designed to be an open resource for the community, cataloging a wide range of scientific papers that explore various output privacy attacks. The repository classifies papers according to various dimensions such as the type of data targeted, the adversarial threat model employed, and the success metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks.

  <p>
    This document will also include the necessary information to navigate the repository, and should offer a rationale for the repositoryâ€™s design, explaining the thought process behind the categorization of the papers. Additionally, we can include examples to illustrate how researchers and practitioners can effectively use the repository to advance their work.
