This document serves as a guide for understanding and using the repository on output privacy attacks and auditing. The repository is designed to be an open resource for the community, cataloging a wide range of scientific papers that explore various output privacy attacks. The repository classifies papers according to various dimensions such as the type of data targeted, the adversarial threat model employed, and the success metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks. 

This document will also include the necessary information to navigate the repository, and should offer a rationale for the repository’s design, explaining the thought process behind the categorization of the papers. Additionally, we can include examples to illustrate how researchers and practitioners can effectively use the repository to advance their work. 

What this repository (currently) does and does not cover
* Currently we only consider “output privacy” papers, not “pure security violations” like timing attacks or other system breaks and not reidentification
* Currently we don’t consider record linkage and reidentification attacks that are tied to tabular microdata releases
