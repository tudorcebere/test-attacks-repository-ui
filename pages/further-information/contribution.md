# Contributing to Acknowledgements  

This project thrives on community collaboration. We welcome updates and additions to the acknowledgements list, whether you are a new contributor, a task force member, or someone who has made contributions to the repository.  

---

## How to Contribute  

Updates to the acknowledgements should be submitted as Pull Requests (PRs).  

- **If you are outside the core team**, you should first create a [fork of this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) and then make a [local clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/cloning-a-repository) of your fork.  
- **If you are a member of the core team**, you can simply make a local clone of this repository.  

In your local clone:  

1. Open the `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` file.  
2. Add your name (and affiliation) under the appropriate section:  
   - **Leadership** (for core project leads)  
   - **Task Force Members** (for ongoing collaborators)  
   - **Repository Contributors** (for those who have made one-time or ongoing technical contributions)  
3. Commit your changes and push them to your fork.  
    ```bash
    git add ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md
    git commit -m 'chore: Add NAME (Affiliation) to acknowledgements'
    git push
    ```
4. After pushing, your terminal will provide a URL to open a pull request. Follow the link and provide any helpful context (e.g., whether the contribution was a code contribution, leadership role, or community support).  

Your PR will be reviewed, and the team may merge it directly or provide feedback.

## Guidelines  

- Please ensure that names are spelled correctly and affiliations are accurate.  
- Use consistent formatting: `Full Name (Affiliation)`.  
- Avoid duplicate entries; check if a name is already listed before adding.  
- For affiliations, list the most relevant institution(s) or organization(s) connected to the contribution.

## Reviewing PRs  

Reviewers should check:  

- The contributor has been added to the correct section (Leadership, Task Force, or Repository Contributors).  
- The formatting is consistent with the rest of the file.  
- No duplicates were introduced.
