Title: Reconstructing Training Data from Trained Neural Networks
Short Description: Shows that in some cases a significant fraction of the training
  data can in fact be reconstructed from the parameters of a trained neural network
  classifier. Proposes a novel reconstruction scheme that stems from recent theoretical
  results about the implicit bias in training neural networks with gradient-based
  methods.
