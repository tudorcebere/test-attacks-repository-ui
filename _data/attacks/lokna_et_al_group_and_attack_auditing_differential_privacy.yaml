Title: 'Group and Attack: Auditing Differential Privacy'
Short Description: Present a novel method to efficiently discover (𝜖, 𝛿) differential
  privacy violations based on the key insight that many (𝜖, 𝛿) pairs can be grouped
  as they result in the same algorithm. Crucially, the method is orthogonal to existing
  approaches and, when combined, results in a faster and more precise violation search.
