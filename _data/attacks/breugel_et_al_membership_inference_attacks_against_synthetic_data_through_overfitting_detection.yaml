Title: Membership inference attacks against synthetic data through overfitting detection
Short Description: Proposes DOMIAS, a density-based MIA model that aims to infer membership
  by targeting local overfitting of the generative model assuming the attacker has
  some knowledge of the underlying data distribution.
