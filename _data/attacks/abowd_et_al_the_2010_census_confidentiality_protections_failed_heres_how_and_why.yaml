Title: The 2010 Census Confidentiality Protections Failed, Here's How and Why
Short Description: The definitive analysis of the reconstruction-abetted reidentification
  attack on the 2010 Census data. Microdata were reconstructed from tabular summaries
  using a series of Integer Programs. An additional Integer Program assesses the solution
  variability. For 97 million of 308 million persons, the reconstruction is provably
  perfect. For perfectly reconstructed persons with atypical characteristics within
  their geography, inferences about these characteristics are correct with probability
  0.95, far in excess of correct inferences from purely statistical models. Inferences
  are also correct with similar probability for typical persons within their geography,
  but such inferences could have been made with a purely statistical model.
