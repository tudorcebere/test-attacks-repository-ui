Title: 'Synthetic is all you need: removing the auxiliary data assumption for membership
  inference attacks against synthetic data'
Short Description: 'Develops new MIAs performed using only the synthetic data in three
  different scenarios: (S1) Black-box access to the generator, (S2) only access to
  the released synthetic dataset and (S3) a theoretical setup as upper bound for the
  attack performance. '
