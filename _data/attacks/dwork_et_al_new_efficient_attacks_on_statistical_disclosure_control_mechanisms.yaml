  abstract="The goal of a statistical database is to provide statistics about a population
  while simultaneously protecting the privacy of the individual records in the database.
  The tension between privacy and usability of statistical databases has attracted
  much attention in statistics, theoretical computer science, security, and database
  communities in recent years. A line of research initiated by Dinur and Nissim investigates
  for a particular type of queries, lower bounds on the distortion needed in order
  to prevent gross violations of privacy. The first result in the current paper simplifies
  and sharpens the Dinur and Nissim result.",
