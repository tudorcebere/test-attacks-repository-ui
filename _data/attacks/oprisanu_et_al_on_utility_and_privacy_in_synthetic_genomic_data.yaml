Title: On utility and privacy in synthetic genomic data
Short Description: Provides the first evaluation of both utility and privacy protection
  of six state-of-the-art models for generating synthetic genomic data. The experiments
  show that no single approach to generate synthetic genomic data yields both high
  utility and strong privacy across the board.
