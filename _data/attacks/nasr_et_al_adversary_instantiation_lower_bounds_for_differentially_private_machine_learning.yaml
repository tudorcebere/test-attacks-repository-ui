Title: 'Adversary instantiation: lower bounds for differentially private machine learning'
Short Description: Instantiates a hypothetical adversary in order to establish lower
  bounds on the probability that the distinguishing game can be won. Uses this adversary
  to evaluate the importance of the adversary capabilities allowed in the privacy
  analysis of DP training algorithms.
