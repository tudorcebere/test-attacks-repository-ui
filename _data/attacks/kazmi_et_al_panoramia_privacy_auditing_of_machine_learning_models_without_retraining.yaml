Title: 'PANORAMIA: Privacy Auditing of Machine Learning Models without Retraining

  '
Short Description: PANORAMIA evaluates ML model privacy by training a membership inference
  attack using generated non-member data, comparing its effectiveness against a baseline
  classifier to measure privacy leakage without requiring real non-member data or
  model modifications.
Data Type: Image, Tabular, Text
Type of Release: Predictive-Model
Threat Model --- Attacker Objective: Membership-Inference
Threat Model --- Attacker Capabilities: .nan
Research Type: Empirical
