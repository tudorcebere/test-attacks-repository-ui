Title: 'On the Inadequacy of Similarity-based Privacy Metrics: Reconstruction Attacks
  against "Truly Anonymous Synthetic Data"'
Short Description: Reviews the privacy metrics offered by leading companies in this
  space and sheds light on a few critical flaws in reasoning about privacy entirely
  via empirical evaluations. Presents a reconstruction attack, ReconSyn, which successfully
  recovers at least 78% of the low-density train records (or outliers) with only black-box
  access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics.
