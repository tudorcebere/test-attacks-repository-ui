Title: Understanding database reconstruction attacks on public data
Short Description: Database reconstruction attacks can be performed by using published
  statistical tables to create a set of mathematical constraints and then solving
  the resulting set of simultaneous equations. Shows how such an attack can be addressed
  by adding noise to the published tabulations, so that the reconstruction no longer
  results in the original data. This has implications for the 2020 Census.
