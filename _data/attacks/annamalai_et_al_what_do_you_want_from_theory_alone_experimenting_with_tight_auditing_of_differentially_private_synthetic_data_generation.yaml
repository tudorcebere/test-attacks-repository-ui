Title: '"What do you want from theory alone?" Experimenting with Tight Auditing of
  Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation'
Short Description: Introduces a systemic auditing framework for differentialy private
  synthetic data generation algorithms by using tight memebership inference attacks
  unfer multiple threat models to verify their privacy guarantees and detect implementation
  violations
Data Type: Tabular
Type of Release: Generative-Model
Threat Model --- Attacker Objective: Membership-Inference
Threat Model --- Attacker Capabilities: 
Research Type: Empirical
