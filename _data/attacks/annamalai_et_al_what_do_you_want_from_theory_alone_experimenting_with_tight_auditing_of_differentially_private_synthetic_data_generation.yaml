Title: '"What do you want from theory alone?" Experimenting with Tight Auditing of
  Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation'

  synthetic data generation algorithms by using tight memebership inference attacks
  unfer multiple threat models to verify their privacy guarantees and detect implementation
  violations
