Title: Bayesian Estimation of Differential Privacy
Short Description: Proposes a novel Bayesian method that greatly reduces sample size,
  and adapt and validate a heuristic to draw more than one sample per trained model.
  The Bayesian method exploits the hypothesis testing interpretation of differential
  privacy to obtain a posterior for ε (not just a confidence interval) from the joint
  posterior of the false positive and false negative rates of membership inference
  attacks.
