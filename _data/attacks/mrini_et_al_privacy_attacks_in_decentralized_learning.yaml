Title: Privacy Attacks in Decentralized Learning
Short Description: The paper designs data reconstruction attacks against Decentralized
  SGD (where nodes in a communication graph alternate between local gradient steps
  and averaging steps with their neighbors). They show it is possible for a small
  subset of (honest but curious) attacker nodes to reconstruct the data from even
  distant nodes in the graph.
