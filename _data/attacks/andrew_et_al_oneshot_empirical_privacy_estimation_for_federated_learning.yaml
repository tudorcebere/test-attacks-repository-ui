Title: One-shot Empirical Privacy Estimation for Federated Learning
Short Description: Introduces a one-shot privacy estimation technique that injects
  random canary clients during federated learning to empirically measure ε-differential
  privacy guarantees by performing membership inference tests using cosine similarities
  between canary updates and model parameters.
