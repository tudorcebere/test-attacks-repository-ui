Title: 'Gan-leaks: a taxonomy of membership inference attacks against generative models'
Short Description: Presents a taxonomy of membership inference attacks, encompassing
  not only existing attacks but also our novel ones. Moreover, provides a theoretically
  grounded attack calibration technique, which consistently boosts the attack performance
  in all cases, across different attack settings, data modalities, and training configurations.
