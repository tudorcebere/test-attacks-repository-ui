Title: 'Updates-leak: Data set inference and reconstruction attacks in online learning'
Short Description: Investigate whether the change in the output of a black-box ML
  model before and after being updated can leak information of the dataset used to
  perform the update, namely the updating set. Proposes four attacks following an
  encoder-decoder formulation, which allows inferring diverse information of the updating
  set.
