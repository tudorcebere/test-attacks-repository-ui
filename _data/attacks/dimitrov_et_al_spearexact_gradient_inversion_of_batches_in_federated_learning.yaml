Title: 'SPEAR:Exact Gradient Inversion of Batches in Federated Learning


  '
Short Description: 'A method for exact reconstruction of inputs from the gradients
  obtained during federated learning for higher batch sizes. The authors provide a
  theoretical foundation and have emperically evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR datasets. '
