Title: 'Debugging Differential Privacy: A Case Study for Privacy Auditing'
Short Description: Inspired by recent advances in auditing which have been used for
  estimating lower bounds on differentially private algorithms, shows that auditing
  can also be used to find flaws in (purportedly) differentially private schemes.
